"""Seizure-probability inference (spectrogram CNN + BiLSTM) for iEEG signals.

Time grid convention used throughout this module
------------------------------------------------
The model consumes spectrograms computed with 1 s segments (``nperseg = fs``)
advanced by 0.5 s (``hop = fs // 2``), keeping the first 100 frequency bins
(0-99 Hz at 1 Hz resolution). Every spectrogram column -- and therefore every
probability value -- describes the 1 s of signal *centred* on its time stamp.
For a signal (or window) starting at sample 0, column ``j`` covers samples
``[j * hop, j * hop + fs)`` and is stamped ``(j + 1) * 0.5`` s.

    """Convert raw signal windows into normalised spectrograms for the model.

    Each row of ``x`` is processed independently:

    1. z-score the raw signal (NaN-aware mean/std over the row; a row with zero
       or undefined std is only mean-centred, never divided by 0),
    2. replace NaN / +-inf samples by 0,
    3. spectrogram with ``nperseg = fs`` (1 s, 1 Hz bins) and a 0.5 s hop
       (``noverlap = fs // 2``), keeping the first 100 bins (0-99 Hz),
    4. z-score every frequency bin over time, using only columns with non-zero
       total power. Columns with zero power (e.g. a flat or zero-filled gap) are
       left at 0. If a bin has zero variance, or fewer than two columns have
       power, that bin is only mean-centred (no division by 0).

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, shape (n_samples,) or (batch_size, n_samples)
        Raw signal. A 1D input is treated as a single window. Rows are windows
        (or channels), columns are samples. Must contain at least ``fs``
        samples (1 s).
    fs : int or float
        Sampling rate in Hz. Must be a whole, even number >= 200; a float such
        as ``500.0`` is accepted. Odd or fractional rates raise ``ValueError``
        -- resample first (see Notes).
    return_axes : bool, optional
        If True, also return the time and frequency axes. Default False.

    Returns
    -------
    t : numpy.ndarray, shape (n_times,)
        Only if ``return_axes``. Time stamp in seconds of every column,
        relative to the first sample of the window: ``(j + 1) * 0.5`` -- the
        centre of the 1 s segment ``[j * 0.5, j * 0.5 + 1)``.
    f : numpy.ndarray, shape (100,)
        Only if ``return_axes``. Frequencies in Hz (0, 1, ..., 99).
    sxx : numpy.ndarray, shape (batch_size, 100, n_times)
        Normalised spectrograms, ``n_times = floor((n_samples - fs) / (fs // 2)) + 1``
        (= ``2 * duration_s - 1`` for whole-second inputs). Always finite.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``fs`` is invalid, ``x`` is not 1D/2D, or shorter than 1 s.

    Notes
    -----
    NaN samples are zero-filled *before* the spectrogram, so the model still
    sees a value there. This low-level function does not mark such columns;
    use :func:`predict_channel_seizure_probability`, which reports any 1 s
    segment containing NaN/inf (or a flat signal) as NaN in its output.

    Where the ``fs`` rules come from: they follow from the spectrogram grid,
    not from the training data (whose sampling rate is not documented in this
    repository). ``nperseg = fs`` needs a whole number of samples per second;
    the 0.5 s hop (``fs / 2`` samples) needs an even rate, otherwise the output
    would drift off the 0.5 s grid; and 100 one-Hz bins (0-99 Hz) need a
    Nyquist frequency of at least 100 Hz, i.e. ``fs >= 200``.

    Anti-aliasing caveat at 200-256 Hz: acquisition (or resampling) anti-alias
    filters usually start attenuating at about 0.4 * fs, i.e. 80-100 Hz at
    these rates. The upper spectrogram bins then hold less power than in
    recordings with a higher native rate, which the model never saw in that
    form: a silent domain shift. Prefer a native rate >= 250-500 Hz, and when
    you resample, keep the new rate high enough that the anti-alias filter's
    transition band lies above 100 Hz.

    """Continuous seizure-probability trace for one (long) iEEG channel.

    The signal is cut into overlapping windows of ``window_s`` seconds every
    ``step_s`` seconds (the "regular" windows of the published method). Each
    window is converted to a spectrogram and run through the model;
    ``discard_edges_s`` seconds are dropped at both window edges (the BiLSTM
    has little context there), and overlapping windows are combined with a
    NaN-ignoring maximum. If the recording end does not fall on the step
    grid, one extra window aligned to the recording end covers the tail; it
    only fills time that no regular window covers and never changes a value
    produced by the regular windows. With the default parameters the output
    is therefore identical to the published method (brainmaze-torch <= 0.1.1)
    wherever that method produced an estimate, except that invalid (gap /
    flat) segments are NaN instead of a number.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, shape (n_samples,)
        Single-channel raw signal (1D). Lists and integer arrays are accepted.
        NaN / +-inf mark missing data (gaps).
    fs : int or float
        Sampling rate in Hz. Must be a whole, even number >= 200 Hz; a float
        such as ``500.0`` is accepted. Resample other rates first.
    model : str or torch.nn.Module, optional
        ``'modelA'`` (published model), ``'modelB'`` (extended training set)
        or an already-loaded model. Default ``'modelA'``. A passed model is
        not mutated (its device and train/eval mode are restored).
    use_cuda : bool, optional
        Run inference on ``cuda:<cuda_number>``. Default False.
    cuda_number : int, optional
        CUDA device index. Default 0.
    n_batch : int, optional
        Windows per inference batch (memory/speed trade-off only; does not
        change the result). Default 128.
    window_s : float, optional
        Window length in seconds; multiple of 0.5, >= 2. Default 300 (the
        length the model was designed for). The recording must be at least
        this long.
    step_s : float, optional
        Step between window starts in seconds; multiple of 0.5. Must satisfy
        ``step_s <= window_s - 2 * discard_edges_s - 0.5`` so that the kept
        (non-discarded) parts of consecutive windows leave no hole (a window
        has ``2 * window_s - 1`` half-second columns). Default 20.
    discard_edges_s : float, optional
        Seconds dropped at each window edge; multiple of 0.5, may be 0.
        Default 10.
    min_valid_fraction : float, optional
        Window preference near gaps. A window is *preferred* if at least this
        fraction of its 1 s segments (spectrogram columns) are valid (finite
        samples, not flat). A valid segment gets the maximum over the
        preferred windows covering it; only if none of them covers it, the
        maximum over all windows covering it is used. This never turns a valid
        segment into NaN; it only lets gap-heavy (mostly zero-filled) windows
        be ignored where a better window exists. Default 0.0: every window is
        preferred, i.e. the published method. Values > 0 change probabilities
        next to long gaps compared with the published method (not validated).
    fill_recording_edges : bool, optional
        The first and last ``discard_edges_s`` seconds of the *recording*
        lie in no window's kept interior. If True (default), they are taken
        from the edge of the first/last window (shorter model context, hence
        less reliable). If False, they are NaN.

    Returns
    -------
    t : numpy.ndarray, shape (n_out,)
        Time in seconds from the first sample: ``t[k] = k * 0.5`` (so the
        value for time ``t`` is at index ``2 * t``),
        ``n_out = n_samples // (fs // 2)``. The last stamp is the centre of
        the last complete 1 s segment.
    prob : numpy.ndarray, shape (n_out,), float64
        Seizure probability in [0, 1] for the 1 s segment centred on
        ``t[k]``, or **NaN where no estimate exists**. NaN is returned for:

        * ``t = 0`` (a 1 s segment centred at 0 s would start before the data),
        * every 1 s segment containing at least one NaN/inf sample (gaps),
        * every 1 s segment over which the signal is constant (flat line,
          e.g. disconnected or saturated channel),
        * the first/last ``discard_edges_s`` s if ``fill_recording_edges`` is
          False.

        NaN therefore always means "not evaluated", never "no seizure"; a
        value is never 0 merely because a time point was not covered. Every
        other (valid) segment always gets a value, whatever
        ``min_valid_fraction`` is.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``x`` is not 1D, ``fs`` is invalid, the window parameters are
        inconsistent, or the recording is shorter than ``window_s``.

    Notes
    -----
    * Gaps are not interpolated. Within an evaluated window the gap samples
      are zero-filled for the model (as in the original implementation),
      which can influence the probability of valid segments next to a gap via
      the BiLSTM context; only the gap segments themselves are masked to NaN.
      To fill short gaps instead (e.g. by interpolation), do so before calling
      this function; filled samples are then treated as valid data. See
      ``min_valid_fraction`` to ignore mostly-gap windows where possible.
    * Probabilities of overlapping windows are combined with a NaN-ignoring
      maximum (``np.fmax``), as in the published method.
